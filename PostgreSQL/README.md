## Introduction

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid and clean development, as well as pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free, open source and has a thriving community.

This framework is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, but it is not a strict implementation of it. It is a framework that follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which means that it avoids repeating code, and it is also based on the principle of convention over configuration, which means that it is not necessary to configure everything, since it already has a default configuration. Based on the "batteries included" principle, it has a large number of libraries that facilitate the development of web applications.

The contents of this repository aim to be a series of tutorials and my personal learning notes on Django. To help others and myself to learn this framework. Going from the basics of Django to the use of Django REST Framework and Django Channels.
